      Xsemantics is a DSL (implemented in Xtext itself) for writing
type systems, reduction rules, interpreters (and in general relation
rules) for languages implemented in Xtext. It then generates
Java code that can be used in your language implemented in Xtext
for scoping and validation (it can also generate a validator
in Java).
